**A sexy minmalistic, low-level kernel for x86 systems, crafted entirely in Assembly by an Engineer, not a programmer.**

## 📝 Project Manifest
LuneOS is my personal, educational endeavor to learn low level systems from the machine code up. The constraint of using pure **Assembly (ASM)** for the entire kernel forces me to absorb a deep understanding of CPU architecture, boot processes, and memory management.
* **Update #1:** NULL

* **Started:** December 8, 2025
